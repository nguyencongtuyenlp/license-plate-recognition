License Plate Recognition + Vehicle Counting System
=====================================================
End-to-end ALPR system with:
    Vehicle Detection → Tracking → Counting → Plate Detection → OCR

Key techniques:
    - Custom PyTorch training (AMP, gradient clipping, cosine annealing)
    - OOP Design Patterns (ABC, Factory, Singleton, Composition)
    - Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Kalman Filter, Hungarian Algorithm)
    - Transfer Learning (FasterRCNN-MobileNetV3-FPN)
